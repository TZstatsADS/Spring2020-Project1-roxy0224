### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  


### According to the wordcloud above, three words of most frequencies are "and", "the" and "you". We can also see some other words clearly in the cloud, like "when", "your", "all", "but", "that", "just", "know", "for" and "with". These words are all function words except for a special word "love". This phenomenon can be easily explained because most lyrics are similar to daily conversation, these words of high frequencies are also mostly used in our daily life according to the grammar. However, "love" can tell us something else. Songs are good ways for artists to express their own feelings, so they talk a lot about love in their lyrics. That's why people love songs, since they resonate with each other when singing a song with emotional lyrics.
